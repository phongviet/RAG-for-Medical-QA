      "Answer: Cancer begins in your cells, which are the building blocks of your body. Normally, your body forms new cells as you need them, replacing old cells that die. Sometimes this process goes wrong. New cells grow even when you don't need them, and old cells don't die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass called a tumor. Tumors can be benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer while malignant ones are. Cells from malignant tumors can invade nearby tissues. They can also break away and spread to other parts of the body.     Cancer is not just one disease but many diseases. There are more than 100 different types of cancer. Most cancers are named for where they start. For example, lung cancer starts in the lung, and breast cancer starts in the breast. The spread of cancer from one part of the body to another is called metastasis. Symptoms and treatment depend on the cancer type and how advanced it is. Most treatment plans may include surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy. Some may involve hormone therapy, biologic therapy, or stem cell transplantation.     NIH: National Cancer Institute\n",

      " Cancer is a disease characterized by abnormal growth and division of cells in the body. It begins in the cells, which are the basic units of life. Normal cells continue to divide and replace damaged cells throughout their lives. However, if these processes go wrong, abnormal cells begin to form and grow uncontrollably. This can lead to various conditions such as tumors, which can be either benign or malignant. Benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body, whereas malignant tumors can spread to other parts of the body and cause serious health problems. The main difference between childhood and adult cancers is that childhood cancers often appear suddenly and have higher rates of cure compared to adults. Symptoms and treatments vary depending on the specific type of cancer. Regular follow-up care is essential to monitor progress and manage potential complications. Consultation with a qualified healthcare professional is recommended for comprehensive evaluation and personalized medical advice.\n"
